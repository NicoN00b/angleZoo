## Description

This is a simple app designed for scalability.  It can show a list of animals at a "zoo" with various attributes.  These animals can be filtered by a pipe for age and can be edited.  New animals can also be added.  In the future, this site could be transitioned to a multiple page platform and could be connected to a firebase JSON for date persistence.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* To run this app you will need to node.js installed.
* After installing the package manager, open your terminal and run:
  * npm install (this should load all the node dependencies needed)
  * bower install (this should make sure the front end is ready to go)
  * gulp build (create the build files necessary to compile it all together)
  * gulp serve (run it on the localhost:3000)
* That should be it.

## Technologies Used

This App uses typescript, angular, node, gulp, bower (and many more dependencies you can view in the package.json). I wrote it in Atom and utilized JSHint to keep it all together.  Shout out to CSS-Tricks for all the good info.
